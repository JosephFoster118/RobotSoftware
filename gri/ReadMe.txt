# Generic Robotics Interface (GRI)
#

The classes defined in this library are generic robotic interfaces
used to define a generic way to write robotic software. This includes
procedures for robot communications (not yet implemented), ways to
interact with hardware over various interfaces (not yet implemented),
and control the flow of the robot code (in development).
